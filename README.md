# Weatherdisplay

Weather Display uses the Ambient Weather API to retrieve data from their line of personal weather stations.

## Purpose

This application was developed using Angular 14 and NGRX.  It will slowly develop into a more fully featured application as I have time.  

## API Keys
In order to use this application, you will need an application API Key and a personal API key in order to access their servers.  

These keys are deliberately kept off of this Git repository as there is enough of my personal data floating around on the web unsupervised <ahem, Facebook>, but I can supply them to you so you can see the output of my personal weather station if need be.  The keys are stored in a file called assets/.env in the following format:

  # Environment variables

  # Application API Key
  applicationKey=xxx

  # API Key for weather station (Device Key)
  apiKey=xxx
  
If you wish to register your own keys, this can be done at the Ambient Weather Website: https://ambientweather.net/account
